\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Seven}{Due: October 31, 2016}

\section*{Introduction}

The Fibonacci sequence includes the numbers in the integer sequence that develops in the following fashion: $0, 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \ldots$. More formally, we can define the {\em n}-th Fibonacci number, denoted $F_n$,
by the following equation $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$. In this laboratory assignment, you will explore and
extend an implementation of iterative and recursive algorithms for calculating the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Moreover, you will investigate how the bit-depth of the variable that stores the output of the Fibonacci calculator can
influence the correctness of the final result. After practicing how to conduct a detailed experimental study of an
algorithm, students will develop and refine their writing skills as they create a comprehensive report of their results.

\section*{Accessing and Using the Fibonacci Benchmarking Framework}

\begin{sloppypar}

  To start this laboratory assignment, you should return to the {\tt cs112F2016-share} Git repository and type the
  ``{\tt git pull}'' command in the terminal window.  Now, you should have a {\tt lab7/FibonacciBenchmark} directory
  that you can explore further.  Once again, please make sure that you can find the source code in this new directory
  and you understand why the directories in the assignment are structured the way that they are. Next, you should use
  GVim to study the source code in the {\tt build.xml} file.  As in the past assignment, you can type the command ``{\tt
  ant compile}'' in a terminal and it will compile the three Java classes and save the bytecode in the correct
  subdirectories inside of the {\tt bin/} directory. Please see the instructor if you cannot get this to work.  Now,
  make sure that you study the three files that are provided to you via Git.

\end{sloppypar}

\begin{sloppypar}

  As part of this assignment, you will examine the following different implementations: (i) {\tt RecursiveFibonacci}
  using {\tt int}, (ii) {\tt RecursiveFibonacci} using {\tt long}, (iii) {\tt IterativeFibonacci} using {\tt int}, and
  (iv) {\tt IterativeFibonacci} using {\tt long}. The {\tt UseFibonacci} class relies on the {\tt Profiler} class is in
  the {\tt profiler.jar} file in the {\tt lib/} directory in the {\tt FibonacciBenchmark} directory.  This means that
  the {\tt UseFibonacci} program will not run correctly unless you have both the {\tt bin/} directory and the {\tt
  profiler.jar} archive inside of your {\tt CLASSPATH} environment variable.

\end{sloppypar}

Try to execute the {\tt UseFibonacci} program for different input values from 0 to 50. You should see the output
from the computation and timing information that is related to the execution of the different algorithms. For example,
try to execute the following command in your terminal window: ``{\tt java edu.allegheny.benchmark.UseFibonacci 10
all}''. What is the output's meaning?

\section*{Implementing Additional Features}

If you study the source code carefully, you will see that the {\tt UseFibonacci} program currently accepts two
command-line arguments. What are they? As part of this laboratory assignment, you must extend the {\tt UseFibonacci}
class and the command-line arguments that it can accept. You should add a third command-line argument that corresponds
to one of the words {\tt int}, {\tt long}, or {\tt all}. After {\tt UseFibonacci} extracts this new command-line
argument, it should use this additional information to run a specific experiment. One valid execution might be: ``{\tt
java edu.allegheny.benchmark.Use\-Fibonacci 10 all long}''. This command line would indicate that you should only
execute the methods within {\tt RecursiveFibonacci} and {\tt IterativeFibonacci} that operate on variables with the
{\tt long} data type. You will need to add conditional logic to {\tt UseFibonacci} in order to correctly add this new
feature. Finally, enhance the code so that it runs an experiment for multiple trials.

\section*{Conducting Experiments to Evaluate Efficiency}
\vspace*{-.05in}

Now you are ready to conduct an experiment to evaluate the performance of the four separate configurations of the
Fibonacci algorithms. You should execute the program with ten different input values from 1 through 50. For each of the
ten input values that you select, you should run the experiment for five trials and report the arithmetic means. Make
sure that your experiment determines when the {\tt int} primitive type can no longer represent the final answer that is
returned by the method that calculates the Fibonacci number. Your experiment also should identify whether the iterative
or the recursive algorithm is more efficient.  Finally, you should try to determine whether the use of {\tt long} or
{\tt int} yields better performance for the iterative and recursive algorithms. Whenever possible, your report should
explain why these trends are evident in your data sets.

Your report should also explain your experimental goals and design by clearly describing the commands that you typed and
the order in which you typed them. It should also include tables of results that list the running times for each of the
different configurations of {\tt UseFibonacci}.  Make sure that you label the tables and directly reference them in the
text of your report. Reports will will receive grade reductions if they contain tables of data and the paragraphs of
analysis that are not properly formatted. Please remember that you should not solely submit the source code of your
program and the output from running it. Instead, you should also write a comprehensive report that identifies and
explains the noteworthy trends in your data sets. Students who want to learn more about recursion should review
Sections 5.1 through 5.5, paying close attention to Section 5.5.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

This assignment invites you to submit a signed and printed version of the following deliverables:

\vspace*{-.1in}
\begin{enumerate}
  \itemsep0pt
  \item Using diagram(s), an explanation of how recursion works in the Java programming language.

  \item A short discussion of the different primitive types that are available in the Java language.

  \item The final version of the commented source code for your Fibonacci benchmarking framework.

  \item A comprehensive written report that fully explains the results of your experimental study.

  \item A reflective commentary on the challenges that you faced when enhancing the benchmarks.

  \item A reflective commentary on the challenges that you faced when conducting the experiments.

\end{enumerate}
\vspace*{-.1in}

Along with turning in a printed version of these deliverables, you should ensure that everything is also available in
the repository that is named according to the convention {\tt cs112F2016-<your user name>}. Please note that students in
the class are responsible for completing and submitting their own version of this assignment. While it is acceptable for
members of this class to have high-level conversations, you should not share source code or full command lines with your
classmates. Deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the
\mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the instructor if you have questions about the policies for this assignment.
